# Sandhills Development site child theme

Designer/Person of contact: [Sean Davis](https://github.com/SDavisMedia)

Parent theme: [Themedd v1.1.x](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/themedd)

#### Reporting issues
If you experience an issue on the site, feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/sandhillsdevelopment/SHD-Site/issues) detailing the problem. If you are unsure of what you're seeing, contact 
Sean directly via Slack.

#### Requesting features/enhancements
Feature requests should be based on an overall goal. That goal will most likely fall under a company "department," like Marketing or Support. Please contact the person in charge of that department to explain the request. That person will then contact the development lead (Chris) to discuss the scope of the enhancement. Once Chris has decided on a necessary course of action, he will open an issue outlining only the essential tasks and considerations.

#### Development environment
The theme uses LESS CSS and compiles that CSS with Grunt. When doing work locally, run `grunt watch` while you work. Any changes to LESS files will result in an updated style.css file.

#### Deployments
Theme deployments are done through [DeployHQ](https://affiliatewp.deployhq.com/). 

* Code pushed to the `master` branch will not go live until a New Deployment is manually initiated in DeployHQ.
